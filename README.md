#String Distance

This is a C# implementation of the Damerau-Levenshten string similarity computation.

The Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance (named after Frederick J. Damerau and Vladimir I. Levenshtein) is a "distance" (string metric) between two strings, i.e., finite sequence of symbols, given by counting the minimum number of operations needed to transform one string into the other, where an operation is defined as an insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character, or a transposition of two adjacent characters.
